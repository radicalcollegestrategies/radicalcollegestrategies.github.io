<p>As an aspiring Computer Science major I knew that competition would be intense to get into top colleges. Thatâ€™s why I engaged with Radical during my senior year to strategize and plan my application process.</p>

<p>Thanks to Radical, I was able to score admissions in <b>top CS schools like UIUC</b>, Maryland, Purdue, and others. I attribute my success largely to Radical helping me <b>package my strengths and ambitions</b> in a cohesive and compelling story in my application. Radical also made the entire college application process streamlined, helping me organize my thoughts, up-level my essays, and <b>manage my time in an extremely efficient manner</b>. Every meeting with Radical was always focused and productive, and helped tailor each and every application. </p>

<p>I get to go to my top college of choice, and would highly recommend Radical for STEM students.</p>

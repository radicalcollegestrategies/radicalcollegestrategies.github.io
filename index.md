    <h3>Meet Geeta Arora</h3>
    <p>I am a college strategist and mentor who has helped numerous high school students discover their unique interests and build a strong cohesive resume for getting into top colleges. I firmly believe that if you pursue your passion, then your life journey automatically becomes a heartfelt college essay!</p>

    <p>In my past life, I was known as Geeta Tarachandani, All India Rank 5 in IIT-JEE, and President's Gold Medalist. Thereafter, I was a software architect at Oracle and in my spare time I coached students for Math, Robotics, and USACO competitions. My students consistently ranked high in MathCounts and AMC-8/10/12. In robotics, my students have won awards at FLL and FRC state championships. In addition, my students have reached USACO Platinum and USACO Camp. I continue to guide my students to excel at their unique talents.</p>

    <p>I observed that the biggest mistake high school students make is to take on a crazy workload which leads to burnout and yet their story does not stand out as impressive to colleges. This led me to found Radical College Strategies.</p>

    <h3>How it all began... From B's to MIT</h3>

    <p>My elder daughter was very strong in Math and Robotics, but had her share of Bâ€™s in humanities classes in middle school. She wanted to get into a top college, but didn't want to take APs in subjects she didn't care for, nor wanted to participate in the usual extra curriculars her friends were taking. </p>
    <p>So I strategized with her, and we picked a couple of activities that she enjoyed and that <b>played to her strengths</b>. She gave those activities her 100%, and stood out as a definite leader! To make time to excel in these activities, she cut out a couple of APs. Her SAT score was far from perfect, yet she got <b>accepted into Computer Science at MIT, CMU and Berkeley EECS!</b> All this while getting her 8 hours of sleep throughout high school. </p>
    <p>The life skills she learned during high school are coming in handy in college. She runs a successful business while working towards her Masters (CS) at MIT! </p>

    <h3>A different journey to MIT</h3>

    <p>My younger daughter had different strengths than her sister. Besides, by
    the time she entered high school, the landscape had changed. Though only 3 years younger to her sister, she faced a lot more competition both at school and nationally. It became clear that we would need fresh strategies.</p>
    
    <p>So we expanded to a richer set of meaningful extra-curriculars. She worked hard to reach well-defined goals in her intended major and community service. She was still able to pursue her creative hobbies and have a social life.</p>
    
    <p>She is now flourishing at <b>MIT Computer Science</b> after getting early acceptance, enjoying the probability class as much as the shakespeare club! </p>

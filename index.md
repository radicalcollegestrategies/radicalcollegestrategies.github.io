    <h2>Meet Geeta Arora</h2>
    <p>I am a college strategist and mentor who has helped numerous high school students discover their passion and build a strong cohesive resume for getting into top colleges. If you spend the time to uncover your passion, then it automatically becomes your heartfelt college essay!</p>
    <p>I am a silicon valley software professional who realized that my real passion lies in working with school-aged students.
    I have coached several students in Robotics, Math and USACO competitions. My students have ranked in the top 3 at the MathCounts East Bay Chapter Competitions for 6 years in a row, and have earned Distinction in AMC8, AMC10 and AMC12. In addition, I have mentored many FLL and FRC teams over the years, and have helped students reach USACO Platinum Level and USACO Camp. </p>
    <p>While mentoring high school students, I discovered that students often take on a crazy workload. Not only can this lead to burnout, it may not even stand out to colleges if the story in incongruent. This led me to found Radical College Strategies.</p>

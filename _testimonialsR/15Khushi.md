<p>Through personal, one on one guidance, Geeta helped me <b>explore different interest areas</b> and narrow down to Data science as a <b>potential major</b>. She guided me through the process and was very patient. She has also helped with course selection and summer program ideas.</p>

<p>I got a 800 on my SAT Math 2 because of her. She prepared a detailed plan to cover all the material within a short time and helped me stay on track.</p>

<p>It was great working with Geeta. Highly recommend any middle/high school students or parents to check her out! </p>

<p>We started with Radical when my son was in 7th grade and had some ideas on what Computer Science projects he would like to start. We signed up with Radical to get guidance on this, as my wife and I had little information on what would be the best course of action for my son to pursue his passion.</p>

<p>We got very <b>crisp guidance</b> to pursue specific activities aligned with my son's interests, along with specific resources on how to go about it. I am excited to say that my son was able to pass bronze and get to USACO silver level in 8th grade, which in itself is a tremendous achievement. Besides, he finds USACO very engaging and <b>we're happy that he found his passion</b>. We are continuing to work with Radical for guidance on his high school journey.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend Radical College Strategies for students who show an interest in STEM.</p>

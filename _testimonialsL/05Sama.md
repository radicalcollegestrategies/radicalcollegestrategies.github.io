<p>During the years I worked with Geeta, she has served as an incredible resource. She mapped my interests to extracurriculars that enabled me to strengthen my profile, showcase my strengths, and present a compelling personal statement.</p> 
<p>With her help throughout the application process, I was able to earn admission to several of my reach colleges, including <b>MIT, CMU, and Caltech.</b></p>

<p>I'm a Junior and so far have taken AP courses based on what was available and what my friends took. I also lead the robotics team at school. I hoped these efforts would be sufficient to get me into my target college, but honestly, I had little clue. Our school counselor provided good but generic advice, and I was looking for something tailored to my situation and ambition.</p>

<p>During our 1-1 conversation, Geeta focused intently on which courses I should take in my senior year and gave me a prioritized list of <b>3 specific summer programs</b> that were strongly aligned with my interest in engineering and robotics, and would make me stand out in my college application. She was very knowledgeable about the dual degree programs I was interested in and guided me on what it would take to get into those programs. Her direct style and clarity of thought provided me a clear sense of where to direct my energy for the remaining time. Looking back, I would have benefited immensely if I had started a conversation with Geeta a couple of years ago.</p>

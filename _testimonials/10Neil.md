<p>The main problem that our family faced as my son entered HS was that he wanted to do a lot of things in a specific area of interest. While we are thankful to have so many options available for learning and growing, there are only 24 hours in a day! </p>
<p>Geeta helped us by brainstorming about how these activities are mundane/fun from my son's perspective and important/non-important from college perspective, to help him choose the right balance. She also suggested other high-impact/low-effort and high-fun/high-importance activities and summer camps.</p>
<p>We continue to work with Geeta to get guidance at every step of the way.</p>

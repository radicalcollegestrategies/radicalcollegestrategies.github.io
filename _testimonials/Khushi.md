<p>Through personal, one on one guidance, Geeta helped me explore different interest areas and narrow down to Data science as a potential major. She guided me through the process and was very patient. She has also helped with course selection and summer program ideas.</p>

<p>I got a 800 on my SAT Math 2 because of her. She prepared a detailed plan to cover all the material within a short time and helped me stay on track.</p>

<p>It was great working with Geeta. Highly recommend any middle/high school students or parents to check her out! </p>

<!--p>As a HS Junior, over the past few years of high-school taken AP courses based on what was available and what my friends took. I had been pursuing my passion of leading the robotics team at school, building a product that I plan to put on Kickstarter and sought some summer internships to improve my skills. I hoped these efforts would be sufficient to get me into my target college, but honestly, I had little clue. Our school counselor provided good but generic advice, and I was looking for something tailored to my situation and ambition.</p>

<p>Geeta provided me a thorough spreadsheet to communicate what I had done so far. During our 1-1 conversation, she focused intently on how I should utilize my summer and which courses I should take in my senior year. She gave me a prioritized list of activities to explore in summer along with 3 specific programs that were strongly aligned with my interest in engineering and robotics, and would make me stand out in my college application. She was very knowledgeable about the dual degree programs I was interested in and guided me on what it would take to get into those programs. Her direct style and clarity of thought provided me a clear sense of where to direct my energy for the remaining time. Looking back, I would have benefited immensely if I had started a conversation with Geeta a couple of years ago.</p-->

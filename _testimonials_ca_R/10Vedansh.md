<p>My son attended a private school in the SF Bay Area. He has been an A student and taken many AP courses, in addition to leading the school robotics team. The school counselor covered the essentials of college admissions but we were lacking specific advice tailored to my son's ambitions and goals.</p>

<p>Geeta adviced my son on course selection for his senior year and prioritized summer opportunities to help him <b>clearly understand the impact of different activities</b> in the admissions process. Many of her suggestions were not obvious or intuitive and made a huge difference in <b>allocation of limited time and energy</b> of an already overwhelmed high schooler. She did a thorough review of college applications and provided a number of <b>critical insights and suggestions</b> that he missed even after several iterations with the school teachers and counselor. </p>

<p>Geeta brings a wealth of experience in helping high potential students stand out in their college applications. Our son was accepted at an <b>Ivy League</b> school and we believe Geeta played a critical role in supporting his efforts.</p>
